extends Node
## Handles sending scores to Quiver Leaderboards (https://quiver.dev/leaderboards/).
## Requires installation of the Quiver Player Accounts plugin.
##
## This class handles populating leaderboards, which can be configured on the Quiver website.
## Leaderboards can have different update strategies:
## * All scores: Records all posted scores
## * Best score: Only record each player's best score
## * Latest score: Only record each player's latest score
## * Cumulative score: Record the cumulative (sum) of each player's scores
##
## If a score fails to post, this class can be configured to handle retries.
## If the game is exited, this class will handle saving scores to disk for a later retry.

enum ScoreFilter {ALL, PLAYER, NEARBY}
enum NearbyAnchor {BEST, LATEST}

## This controls the maximum size of the request queue that is saved to disk
## in the situation the scores weren't able to be successfully posted.
## In pathological cases, we drop the lowest scores if the queue grows too big.
